# Potato-Disease-Classification-in-an-Uncontrolled-Environment
# Potato Disease Classification using InceptionV3

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning model developed to classify potato diseases using the InceptionV3 architecture. The model is designed to work in uncontrolled environments, providing farmers with a tool to identify diseases affecting their potato crops.

## Dataset

The dataset used to train and evaluate the model is available on [Mendeley](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/ptz377bwb8/1). It consists of images of healthy potatoes and potatoes affected by various diseases, including:

- Bacteria
- Fungi
- Phytophthora
- Healthy
- Pest
- Virus
- Nematode

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
